# Hotel Admin Panel

## Project Overview
The Hotel Admin Panel is a web-based application designed to facilitate hotel reservation management. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing guest registrations, monitoring reservations, and accessing insightful dashboards to track operational metrics efficiently. Built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to streamline hotel administration and enhance guest experience management.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd hotel-admin-panel
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The application does not require any special server setup and can run directly from your local file system.

## Usage
Once the application is open in a browser:

- **Home Page (index.html)**: Access the main features of the Hotel Admin Panel.
- **Add Guest (add-guest.html)**: Use this form to register new guests by providing required information such as name, email, phone number, check-in, and check-out dates.
- **Dashboard (dashboard.html)**: Monitor and manage guest data, check-ins, and check-outs with a comprehensive dashboard.

## Features
- **Guest Registration**: An intuitive form for adding new guests with data validation.
- **Informative Dashboard**: Displays total guests, check-ins, and check-outs for better management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and aesthetically pleasing design using Tailwind CSS.

- **Dynamic Guest List**: Automatic updates of the guest list on the dashboard with filter functionality.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies:
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
